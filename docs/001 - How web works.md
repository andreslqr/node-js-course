**Request:** The web request for the server containing data as url, method, headers, cookies, body objects, files, etc.

**Server:** The main application which receive the request from the client, and execute any business logic.

**Response:** The result of the process of the server sended back from origin client.

**Client:** The response for the initial request from the client, this response also has data as headers, cookies, body objects, files, etc.

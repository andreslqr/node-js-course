# The MVC pattern

The MVC pattern is a way to build software, based on 3 categories:

- Models
- Views
- Controllers

## Models

- Responsible for representing data
- Manage the data (files, memory, databases)
- Data-related logic

## Views

- What the users sees
- Less logic 

## Controllers

- Connect Models and Views
- Only Communication between logics
